# ASCII Renderer
An ASCII renderer I'm working on for fun... but also as a challenge. The rules I've given myself are:

- No APIs that make it easy, I can use Log4J2 or something else that doesn't affect the rendering itself.
- yeah i havent thought of anything else 🤷‍♂️

please don't hate my garbage code 🙂

# ASCII Renderer

An ASCII renderer I'm working on for fun... but also as a challenge. The rules I've given myself are:

- No APIs that make it easy, I can use Log4J2 or something else that doesn't affect the rendering itself.
- yeah i havent thought of anything else ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Absolutely **no** *external* APIs used to ease the task of rendering or displaying a window

## What is it?

It is exactly what is sounds like, a renderer that uses ASCII characters in a pseudo-terminal window instead of colors and stuff.
It uses JSwing to create a window, as it's impossible otherwise in Java, but still doesn't use complex APIs.
